FEATURES:
Add support for mobile. (arrow keys, etc.).
Add percentage while game is loading (http://phaser.io/examples/v2/loader/load-events).
Upload GameMenu on github. Well documented example: https://github.com/bmarwane/phaser.healthbar
Add eye candy for the battle. Use sounds, etc.
Add GameOver logic.
Update the README.md.
Fix the login form like: http://bootsnipp.com/tags/registration and add the first screen of the game like the conceptArt.png.
Consider adding Phaser.Camera.shake effect in the battle (on Attack and Spell).
Dealing with locations.
Add towns and stuff - https://github.com/thansber/final-fantasy-1-old/tree/master/js/data. This guy has almost everything. Or here - http://www.spriters-resource.com/submitter/Karrior+Cyredghymn/ (Not every place is ripped).
Should GameMenu have a "stretchToFit" configuration option, which should stretch the menu options text horizontal/vertical or both. Right now text is stretched only if it exceeds the menu bounds.
See how status effects inflict after monster or spell attacks. Mechanics are listed here: http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_statuses#Mechanics_of_Status_Resistance
I think there is no "Defend" option in the battle, so remove it. Reference: http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/File:FFI_Petrify_Status_PS.png.
FINAL TASK: Implement level up logic. Implement enemies level logic. Implement all logics in the game. Here are the formulas: http://www.ffcompendium.com/h/faqs/ff1bsiron.txt

BUGS:
The project cannot be used completely offline, the tests cannot run offline because of Node.js bug.
Worldmap texture is too big so it does not load correctly on my Samsung Galaxy J5 with Chrome and default Browser.
The party is not exactly centered in the world.

REFACTORING:
All the things around Spells are kinda messy. Think of an appropriate approach for spells. Enable casting a spell animations.
  Here is the spell sheet: http://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/finalfantasy1/sheet/56957/
  Here is the spell explanation: http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Final_Fantasy_NES_Spell_Images
  Try finding the PSP spell sheet. It is very hard.
Consider using EventEmmiter for battle start and battle end.
Consider using EventEmmiter when waiting the battle animations to finish.
Consider having a savegame files rather than storing the data in the DB.
Move Unit, Character, Monster, UnitStats classes to floder named "unit". Move other classes accordingly. Or do I need this?
Add tests for all stable classes.
Consider BattleUnits not to be a Phaser.Group wrapper but to extend Phaser.Group.
Function findUserWithProperty in /services/login/utils.js can be achieved using underscore.
Implement function which loads whole folder with configuration files or use filewalker module.
